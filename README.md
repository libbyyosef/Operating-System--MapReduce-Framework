# Operating System - MapReduce Framework
**Introduction**

This project is an implementation of a MapReduce framework, providing a parallel processing model for large-scale data processing. The framework is designed to be used with a multithreaded environment and supports the execution of map and reduce tasks.

**Barrier Class (Barrier.h)**

**Description**

The *Barrier* class provides a multiple-use barrier synchronization mechanism for coordinating threads in a parallel processing environment. It is utilized within the MapReduce framework to synchronize different stages of the processing.

**MapReduce Client Interface (MapReduceClient.h)**

**Description**

The *MapReduceClient* class defines the interface that users of the MapReduce framework must implement. It includes functions for mapping and reducing data.

**MapReduce Framework Implementation (MapReduceFramework.cpp)**

**Description**

The *MapReduceFramework.cpp* file contains the implementation of the MapReduce framework. It includes functions for initializing and running MapReduce jobs, handling different stages of the processing, and managing synchronization between threads.
